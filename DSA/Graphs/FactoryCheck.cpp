// The Graph Factory Check

// Code Monk, eager after learning about Graphs, visited a Graph-making factory where graphs were meticulously crafted. Today, one worker was absent due to illness. Monk decided to fill in and undertake her role.

// The task at hand was to identify whether an incoming graph constituted a tree or not. He was provided with the number of vertices (N) and the degree of each vertex.

// Can you help Monk determine if the graph qualifies as a tree?

// Input Format:

// The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of vertices.
// The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the degrees of the N vertices.
// Output Format:

// Print "Yes" (without quotes) if the graph is a tree.
// Print "No" (without quotes) if the graph does not meet the criteria of a tree.
// Constraints:

// 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
// 1 ≤ Degreei ≤ 1000
// Note: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path and contains no cycles.

// Sample Input:


// 3
// 1 2 1
// Sample Output:


// Yes
